## Navigating the Directory

1. The TeX source and accompanying files for the report can be found in the
   `/report/` directory, as well as the [final PDF report](report/report.pdf)

2. [Monte Carlo Pricer.ipynb](Monte\ Carlo\ Pricer.ipynb) holds most of the code
   associated with pricing options given a local volatility function, as well
   as the tests on the accuracy of the Monte Carlo pricings.
