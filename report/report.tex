\begin{abstract}
In Nobel-prize winning work, Black, Merton, and Scholes developed a model to
price options. The tractability of the model revolutionized options pricing and
allowed for the derivatives to become widely traded. However, the predictions of
the model run counterfactual to empirically observed prices. In this paper, we
consider a generalization to the Black-Scholes model, the local-volatility
model. This generalization gives us more degrees of freedom to fit the prices we
observe. With the additional expressiveness, however, come numerical
complications. Black-Scholes requires fitting only a single number known as the
\emph{implied volatility}, but the local volatility model requires fitting an
entire multi-dimensional function. We explore these complications and arrive at
solutions that are assessed for numerical stability and accuracy to price
out-of-sample options.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

\subsection{Options Terminology}
\label{subsec:terminology}

Before delving into the theoretical and numerical results, we briefly summarize
options terminology. An option is a \emph{derivative} on some asset, henceforth
called the \emph{underlying}---i.e.\ it's value is \emph{derived} from the value
of the underlying. The owner of a call (resp. put) option has the right but not
the obligation to buy (resp. sell) the underlying asset at a given price at some
date in the future.

The price at which the holder of the option can buy/sell is called the
\emph{strike price}, denoted $K$. Invoking the right to buy or sell is called
\emph{exercising} the option. The last time at which the holder can exercise is
called the \emph{expiry}, denoted as time $T$. The value of the underlying asset
at time $t$ is denoted as $S_t$ (and sometimes the subscript is dropped whenever
it is implied). 

The payoff of a call option at expiry is thus given by,
\begin{equation}
 \max(S_T - K, 0) 
\label{eqn:callpayoff}
\end{equation}
because the owner will only exercise it if the underlying is worth more than the
strike price. This function gives rise the characteristic ``hockey-stick''
payoff diagram of an option at expiry,

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics{figs/calloptpayoff}
\caption{Payoff of call option}
\label{fig:calloptpayoff}
\end{figure}


The payoff of a put option is very similar to equation \ref{eqn:callpayoff},
\begin{equation}
 \max(K-S_T, 0) 
\end{equation}
because the owner of the option will only exercise it if the underlying is worth
less than the strike price, 
and the payoff curve looks like its mirror image,

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics{figs/putoptpayoff}
\caption{Payoff of put option}
\label{fig:putoptpayoff}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Risk-Neutral Pricing}
\label{subsec:riskneutral}

The value of an option at expiry is easily observable and displayed in the
figures in Section \ref{subsec:terminology}. However, before time $T$, the
value of $S_T$ is a random variable. Asset pricing (change of measure) 
theorems \citep{cochrane2009asset}
allow us to write the value of a call option as the discounted expectation of
the payoff under what we call the \emph{risk-neutral distribution},
\begin{equation}
 \frac{C(S_0, K, T)}{e^{-rT}} = \int_K^\infty (S - K)
\underbrace{\phi(S, T; S_0)}_\text{risk-neutral PDF} \, dS
\label{eqn:riskneutralpricing}
\end{equation}
However, in order to make any progress beyond this, we need to make a further
assumption about what this risk-neutral distribution looks like.

\subsection{Black-Scholes Model}
\label{subsec:bs}
The Black-Scholes model makes one such assumption by writing how the asset
diffuses over time. In particular, the Black-Scholes model treates the asset
price as a geometric Brownian motion represented by the following stochastic
difference equation:
\begin{equation}
 \frac{dS}{S} = r dt + \sigma dW 
\end{equation}
where $W$ is Brownian motion and $\sigma$ is a constant value called the
\emph{implied volatility}. 

This forces the risk-neutral distribution to be log-normal and makes
finding the price analytically tractable. In particular, since the only pricing
input into this model that we do not observe is the implied volatility, we can
quote price as a function of implied volatility (e.g. an option is said to cost
$\sigma=16\%$ if its price is consistent with the price the Black-Scholes model
would predict if $\sigma=16\%$).

Thus, Black-Scholes predicts that if $\sigma$ is indeed a constant, then for any
option written on the same underlying (regardless of strike price or expiry),
that the implied volatility will be (approximately) constant. However, this is
directly counterfactual to the options prices that we observe. For example,
looking at the prices of AAPL options that expire on April 2018 retrieved on
December 17$^\text{th}$, 2017 from Yahoo Finance, we get the following curve

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics{figs/aapliv}
\caption{Implied volatility from AAPL options.}
\label{fig:aapliv}
\end{figure}

While the data is noisy, particularly for deep-in-the money\footnote{A call
(resp. put) option is said to be \emph{in-the-money} when $S_0 > K$ (resp. $S_0
< K$), \emph{out-of-the-money} when $S_0 < K$ (resp. $S_0 > K$), and at the
money if $S_0 = K$.} puts which are hardly ever traded, the graph is
unmistakably not constant. Moreover, AAPL is not an exception: most graphs of
implied volatility versus strike have a similar shape. These deviations from
Black-Scholes also correspond to intuitive qualitative ideas. If the price of
AAPL has just plunged 50\%, it is palatable to think there is a lot of investor
uncertainty, and that the future price of AAPL will diffuse with higher
volatility than if it is just up 5\%.  Thus, the assumption of constant $\sigma$
is suspect.

\subsection{Local Volatility Theory}
\label{sec:localvoltheory}

The \emph{local-volatility model} directly responds this shortcoming of the
Black-Scholes model by rewriting the diffusion equation as,
\begin{equation}
 \frac{dS}{S} = r dt + \sigma(S,t) dW 
\end{equation}
such that the volatility is no longer a global constant, but rather a function
of spot-price and time. We refer to this function as the \emph{local volatility
function}, and the value of the function at any given point as the \emph{local
volatility}. Note of course that in the special case when $\sigma$ is a constant
function, we have simply recovered the Black-Scholes model. We will make use of
this fact when we need to confirm the numerical results of the local volatility
model against theoretical closed-forms.

In the general case, though, we care about what the local volatility surface
says about prices and vice-versa. To this end, we can invoke
\cite{dupire1997pricing}. The first thing to note is that we can differentiate
our risk-neutral pricing formula with respect to $K$ twice to get that,
\begin{equation}
 e^{-rT} \phi(K, T; S_0) = \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial K^2}.
\end{equation}
Moreover, because we have a diffusion rule for the underlying $S_t$, the
probability distributions must satisfy 
the \emph{Fokker-Planck equation} \citep{risken1996fokker},\footnote{We
display this without drift. In practice, we can do this for the underlying
itself if is driftless, but if we are worried about drift, we can simply use the
forward price which is by construction a martingale}
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial C}{\partial T} = \frac{1}{2} e^{rT} \sigma^2 K^2 \frac{\partial^2
C}{\partial K^2}
\end{equation}
Rearranging gives us Dupire's equation,
\begin{equation}
 \sigma^2(K, T, S_0) = \frac{ \frac{\partial C}{\partial T} e^{-rT}}
{\frac{1}{2} K^2 \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial K^2}}.
\end{equation}
We can also rewrite this assuming 0 interest rates, which we will assume going
forward for simplicity,
\begin{equation}
 \sigma^2(K, T, S_0) = \frac{ \frac{\partial C}{\partial T}}
{\frac{1}{2} K^2 \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial K^2}}.
\end{equation}

There are a couple notable takeaways from this equation. First of all, if we
fully and perfectly observed a continuum of option prices for all strikes and
expiries, we would be able to uniquely determine the local volatility surface.
Moreover, we can do this \emph{regardless} of what the option prices
are\footnote{We get negative local volatility if arbitrage conditions are
violated, but we assume this does not happen.}. This means that unlike
Black-Scholes, the local volatility model can perfectly fit what we see, and we
should be apprehensive of overfitting.


\section{Monte Carlo Pricing}
\label{sec:localvolpricing}

In this section, we will concern ourselves with what we can do once we have the
local volatility surface. In particular, our main objective will be to price
options. Note that the prices may exist in the market (e.g.\ as a sanity check
for our model), or they may not (e.g.\ to price options with expiries that are
not quoted, giving our model predictive power).

One way to do this is by realizing that the price is an expectation under the
risk-neutral distribution of the pay-off random variable (as in Equation
\ref{eqn:riskneutralpricing}). Thus, if we can sample from this distribution, we
can invoke the law of large numbers and get an estimate for its average with
sufficient samples. 

In Monte Carlo pricing, we draw from the distribution of $S_T$ and compute
option prices. We start with the stochastic difference equation\footnote{We
assume interest rates are zero, and so there is no drift term for simplicity}
%
\[ dS_t = S_t \sigma(S_t,t) \, dW_t, \]
%
and approximate with finite differences 
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:euler-maruyama}
\tilde S_{t_{k+1}} - \tilde S_{t_k} = \tilde S_{t_k} \sigma(\tilde S_{t_k},
t_k)\, (W_{t_{k+1}} - W_{t_k}) = \tilde S_{t_k} \sigma(\tilde S_{t_k}, t_k)
\sqrt{t_{k+1}-t_k} Z_k,
\end{equation}
%
for some $Z_k = \frac{W_{t_{k+1}} - W_{t_k}}{\sqrt{t_{k+1}-t_k}} \sim
\Norm(0,1)$. This is the well-known \emph{Euler-Maruyama method}, an extension
of the forward Euler method in stochastic calculus. It has been shown that the
recursively-computed sequence $\tilde S_{t_1},\ldots, \tilde S_{t_N}$ converges
to a draw from the true stochastic process $S_t$ as the mesh of the partition
$\{t_1,\ldots,t_N\}$ tends to zero \citep{dobrow2016introduction}. We implement
this procedure in Listing \ref{lst:sampleendprice}.

In this implementation, we have two types of numerical error to reason about.
The first is simply sampling error. Because we are only taking a finitely many
number of draws from the distribution, our sample mean will differ from the
true mean. In addition, the distribution that we sample from will not be
precisely the distribution of $S_T$ because our partition is finite. We call the
difference of  means of these two distributions our \emph{discretization error}.

\subsection{Sampling Error}

Reasoning about sampling error is straightforward: by the Central Limit Theorem,
if we sample possible prices $P_1, \ldots, P_N$, then the distribution of their
sample mean will be appriximately distributed as,
\[ \overline{P} \sim \mathcal{N}\left( \mu_P, \frac{\sigma_P}{\sqrt{N}} \right)
\]
for big enough $N$. In general, we can estimate $\sigma_P$ from our sample, and
we can bring down the error because it is decreases in $\sqrt{n}$. 

We can empirically confirm this by using Black-Scholes. If our local volality
function is constant, this means that we can analytically price options. It also
means that there is no discretization error. Thus, we can run a couple samples
of size $10^5$ from the price distribution, price call options with each sample,
and compare to the Black-Scholes theoretical price and standard error. The
results of this are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:mcsamplingerror}.


\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics{figs/mcsamplingerror}
\caption{Monte Carlo sampling error $n=10^5$}
\label{fig:mcsamplingerror}
\end{figure}

The figure shows us that $10^5$ samples are enough to get a pricing error of a
couple cents, and by consequence, that $10^6$ samples are enough to get pricing
error on the order of a cent. Moreover, pricing errors are smaller for far out
of the money calls, which makes sense because the distribution of payoffs will
be dominated by a point-mass at 0 (most far out of the money calls expire out of
the money).

\subsection{Discretization Error (Theory)}

Having understood the behavior of the sampling error, we still have to bound the
discretization error. Let $\Delta t = t_{k+1} - t_k$
and suppose that $S_{t_k}$ is a draw from the true distribution. Let
$S_{t_{k+1}}$ be drawn from the true distribution conditional on $S_{t_k}$, and
let $\tilde S_{t_{k+1}}$ be the corresponding finite difference approximation
via \eqref{eq:euler-maruyama} with respect to the same draw from the Brownian
motion $W_t$. We have the following bounds on convergence
\citep{higham2001algorithmic}:

\begin{align}
E\abs{S_{t_{k+1}} - \tilde S_{t_{k+1}}} &\le C_1(\Delta t)^{1/2}
\tag{Strong convergence} \\ 
\abs{E(g(\tilde S_{t_{k+1}})) - E (g(S_{t_{k+1}}))} &\le C_2
\Delta t \tag{Weak convergence}
\end{align}

for a $g$ that satisfies certain regularity conditions. 
Applying an equally-spaced partition to $[0,T]$ with step-size $\Delta t$, we
immediately observe that the draws from the distribution at expiry must obey the
same bounds of convergence:

\begin{align*}
E\abs{S_{T} - \tilde S_{T}} &= O\pr{(\Delta t)^{1/2}} \\
\abs{E(g(\tilde S_{{T}})) - E (g(S_{T}))} &= O(\Delta t).
\end{align*}

Since we apply Euler-Murayama method to option pricing, we are more interested
in the error $\abs{E(g(\tilde S_T)) - E(g(S_T))},$ where $g$ is a function of
the form $g(S_T) = \max(S_T - K, 0)$ (for call options). The
nondifferentiability of $g$ may pose some concern, as
\cite{higham2001algorithmic} notes that the weak convergence bound works for $g$
smooth. However, since there exists a sequence of smooth functions $\tilde g$
that uniformly converges to $g(S_T) = \max(S_T - K, 0)$, we have 

\[
\abs{E(g(\tilde S_T)) - E(g(S_T))} \le 2\norm{g-\tilde g}_\infty + \abs{E(\tilde
g(\tilde S_{{T}})) - E (\tilde g(S_{T}))},
\]

where $\norm{g-\tilde g}_\infty$ can be arbitrarily small. 

\subsection{Discretization Error (Numerical Convergence)}

Let $S_0 = 1, K = 1.1$, and \[\sigma(S, t) = \min\pr{0.1 + (S - 1)^2, 0.5}.\]
Consider a call option at expiry $T = 1$ with strike $K$, whose payoff is
$\max(S_T, K) - K$. Assume zero interest rate. We approximate the expectation
with sample mean with sample size $10^6$. We approximate the true value of the
option by computing the Euler-Murayama approximation with step-size equalling
$1/200$. We then plot the pricing errors of Euler-Murayama approximations with
step size $1/n$ for $n=1,\ldots,40$ in Figure~\ref{fig:log-log}. 

% TODO: can we get a similar figure aesthetic for this? -FR
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figs/montecarlo_discrete.png}
    \caption{Log-log plot of pricing error against $\Delta t$}
    \label{fig:log-log}
\end{figure}

It is difficult to control the Monte Carlo sampling error, due to computational
resource constraints, but we do observe approximately a first-order convergence
pattern. 
  
Thus, for a known $\sigma^2$, we can limit the size of the discretization error
at rate $O(\Delta t)$, and the size of the sampling error at rate $O(n^{-1/2})$
where $n$ is the sample size. The theory and the numerical experimentation
suggests that the Monte Carlo pricing method is numerically robust. 

\subsection{Discretization Error (Across Strikes)}

In the previous numerical experiment, we explored the asymptotics of
discretization error. However, this is only half the story: we are also
interested in how our discretization error affects the pricing of options with
different strikes. To this end, we will use an artificial local volatility
function,
\[ \sigma(S_t, t) = \min(\max(0.16 + 10^{-4}(S_t - 100)^2, 0), 0.3) \]
and price one-year-dated call options with a different number of discretizations
ranging from 1 to 25. We plot the 1-standard-error intervals minus our most
accurate point estimate ($10^6$ samples with 100 discretizations) for each of
these pricings in Figure \ref{fig:discretizationK}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics{figs/discretizationK.pdf}
\caption{Pricing errors for different discretizations}
\label{fig:discretizationK}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Sensitivity to Local Volatility}

Thus far, we have talked about pricing errors: differences between an option
price we calculate and the true option price under asset diffusion as specified
by the local volatility function. In practice, though, we will not know the true
local volatility function since we must estimate it. This means that we also
care about the pricing \emph{sensitivy}, i.e.\ how prices change for a change in
the local volatility function.


\section{Fitting Local Volatility}
\label{sec:localvolfitting}



% \section{Theoretical analysis of numerical methods} \label{sec:theory} Our
% approach involves two separate applications of numerical techniques. First, we
% observe existing option prices $C(K,T)$ and compute the local volatility
% function via Dupire's equation \[ \sigma^2 =
% \frac{\diff{C}{T}}{\frac{1}{2}K^2\diff{^2C}{K^2}}.  \] Second, given an
% estimate of the local volatility $\sigma^2$, we numerically predict option
% prices. In this section, we discuss some theoretical difficulties in deriving
% analytical bounds on our approximations. In particular, we proceed in reverse
% order. We first discuss the numerical errors of Monte Carlo pricing, assuming
% the local volatility $\sigma^2$ is known.


\subsection{Theoretical Difficulties}
However, computing $\sigma^2$ from observed data accurately is a much more
difficult task. We illustrate the main difficulty below.

Let $A = \diff{C}{T} + e_1$ and $B = \diff{^2C}{K^2} + e_2$ be two approximations. Then \[
\frac{A}{\frac{1}{2}K^2 B} = \sigma^2 \frac{\diff{^2C}{K^2}}{\diff{^2C}{K^2} + e_2} + \frac{e_1}{\frac{1}{2}K^2 B}.
\]
Thus the absolute error \[
\abs{\frac{A}{\frac{1}{2}K^2 B} - \sigma^2} \le \sigma^2 \abs{\frac{e_2}{\diff{^2C}{K^2}+e_2}} + \abs{\frac{e_1}{\frac{1}{2}K^2B}}.
\]
Since $\diff{^2C}{K^2} > 0$, it should be unsurprising that the error vanishes
as $e_1,e_2 \to 0$. However, note that deep-in-the-money options are virtually
indistinguishable from the underlying asset, whereas deep-out-of-the-money
options are virtually worthless. Thus $C$ is almost linear as a function of $K$
when $K$ is away from $S_0$.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics{figs/intrinsicvalue}
\caption{Option Intrinsic and Time Value}
\label{fig:intrinsicvalue}
\end{figure}

Even though $\diff{^2C}{K^2} > 0$, the infimum of this second derivative is
zero. This presents a first difficulty when attempting to bound the error of the
approximations. A second challenge arises from the discreteness of empirical
prices. We cannot evaluate the function $C(K,T)$ anywhere we wish, but rather we
only observe its values on a grid whose fineness is capped at the finest
intervals that prices are quoted in. To make matters worse, the prices quoted
are accurate to $\$0.01$, and so it is as if we are working in a world where
machine precision is nontrivially large.


The usual centered difference approximations have
\[
|e_1|\le \frac{h_1^2}{6}\sup \abs{\diff{^3C}{T^3}} + \frac{\epsilon}{2h_1}
\qquad |e_2| \le \frac{h_2^2}{12}\sup \abs{\diff{^4C}{K^4}} +
\frac{2\epsilon}{h_2^2}.
\]
For values of $\diff{^2C}{K^2}$ sufficiently large, it is plausible that these
approximations are sufficiently accurate. However, the approximation is
certainly not accurate for values of $\diff{^2C}{K^2}$ close to zero. Yet for
these values, which correspond to deep-money options, the option price is
virtually known---the large errors in $\sigma^2$ for $K$ far away from $S_0$ is
weighted by the extremely small probability that such errors matter. Such
weighting is analytically intractable, and we mainly focus on numerical
experimentation.
